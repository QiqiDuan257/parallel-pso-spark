# parallel-pso-spark

**Spark-based Parallel Particle Swarm Optimizer for Computationally Expensive Continuous Function Optimization.**

This is an open-source GitHub project complementary to the conference paper, which has been submitted to [PPSN 2018](http://ppsn2018.dei.uc.pt/) (under review).

## How to Run

**Prerequisites**: you should have some basic knowledge of both the *Scala* programming langauge and the *Spark* clustering computing framework. Otherwise, we strongly encourage you to refer to [the Scala office website](http://www.scala-lang.org/) and [the Spark office website](http://spark.apache.org/) for more details. Don't worry, we also provide some practical guidance to make the usage of the *parallel-pso-spark* library easy as soon as possible. **If any questions, please don't hesitate to contact us (email: duanqq257@qq.com)**.

First, you should have a Spark commodity cluster available. Considering the complexity of building a private Spark commodity cluster, we provide a practical guidance to install it on CentOS, as presented below:

If you aleady have a Spark commodity cluster available, we suggest you to use [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), probably the best IDE to run the Java, Scala, and Spark source code. Considering the complexity of both Scala and Spark to newcomers, we provide a practical guidance to run the Spark program on the WINDOWS development environment, which can automatically invoke the remote Spark commodity cluster, as presented below:
